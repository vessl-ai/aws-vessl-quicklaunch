to monitoring. These features are available under Cluster.

* Single-command integration — Set up a hybrid or multi-cloud infrastructure with a single command.
* GPU-accelerated workloads — Run training, optimization, and inference tasks on GPUs in seconds
* Resource optimization — Match and scale workloads automatically based on the required compute resources
* Cluster dashboard — Monitor real-time usage and incident & health status of clusters down to each node.
* Reproducibility — Record runtime metadata such as hardware and instance specifications.
